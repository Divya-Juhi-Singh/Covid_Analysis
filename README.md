# Real Time Covid Data Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------
## About
A tiny project on 'Real Time Covid Data Analysis' is about exploring, visualising and plotting the covid dataset on map using a powerful 
Data Mining tool [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/). In this project, a real time covid dataset is used provided by CSSE at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD
on their [github page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data).

## Requirements
Get Orange installed on your system from the [download link](https://orangedatamining.com/download/).

## Add-ons Required
After the successful set up, start the Orange and navigate through "Options" on the top left corner and click on "Add-ons..." under it. A pop up 
window "Installer - Orange" appears, add the required packages "Geo" and "TimeSeries" and then restart Orange.
